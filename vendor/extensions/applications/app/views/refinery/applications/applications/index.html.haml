        %p When all parts of your application are complete you will be able to formally submit it to us for consideration. Until then, we won't look at it.
        %p If you have any questions during the application process, please #{link_to 'get in touch with us', refinery.inquiries_new_inquiry_path}! We want you to be successful in Montessori, and your success starts now.
